##Baseball Sparklines

Baseball season results visualized as [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline). This is a d3-based copy of the charts shown on p. 174 of [The Visual Display of Quantative Information by Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) (2nd ed.) as well as p. 54 of [Beautiful Evidence](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be).

All [post-deadball era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-ball_era) (1919 – 2017) seasons are available. Enough babbling, [check it out](http://swingley.github.io/baseball-sparklines/)! Use the "Change Year" button in the upper-right to select a year (or fiddle with the query string such as [?year=2001](http://swingley.github.io/baseball-sparklines/?year=2001)).

On larger screens, tap a chart to make it bigger. Here's a gif showing that effect in action: ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3j2M3h0R2Z0Y2Q2H2L0Y/Screen%20Recording%202016-02-04%20at%2007.03%20PM.gif?v=dea6a471)

Win-loss data was [scraped](https://github.com/swingley/baseball-scrape-win-loss-data) from [baseball-reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/).
